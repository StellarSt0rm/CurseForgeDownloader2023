### Version: 1.6
Download Modpacks From CurseForge, BETA
<br>
$\color{red}\text{‚üÅ}$ Script Can Stop Working In The Future Due To Hosts Changing Stuff
<br>
<br>
Tested With "Colony A New Odyssey - STABLE-1.0.7", Out Of 176 Mods, All Were Handled Correctly ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥
<br>
<br>
<br>
Code Is Fully $\color{blue}\text{COMMENTED}$ For Your Convenience üöÄ
<br>
<br>

## How To Install
1. Download `CSDownloader.py` (And `requirements.txt`)From The Repo Tree (Will Be Put As Releases In The Future)
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (While In The Same Folder As The File)
3. Run `python CSDownloader.py ./<path-to-modpack>` And Wait!
   <br>(The Script Will Put Everything In The "overrides" Folder Next To The ZIP File; Script Can Be Run From Anywhere Now)

<br>

## Features
   1. Detailed Mode (SLOW - DEF)
      <br>Gives Detailed Output Of What The Script Is Doing
      <br>![DetailedMode](https://github.com/StellarSt0rm/CurseForgeDownloader2023/blob/b2ab628dab5f163cb7f609a015f3b2c408b4e312/README-RES/DetailedM.png)
      <br>
      <br>
   2. Threaded Mode (FAST - Bad For Slow Computers)
      <br>Goes BLAZINGLY FAST üöÄ ; Good For BIG Modpacks
      <br>$\color{red}\text{‚üÅ}$ Fast Is Relative To How Big The Modpack Is, But It's Faster Than Detailed Mode
      <br>Usage: `python CSDownloader.py -t <num / or "max">`
      <br>"max" Will Set The Max To '30', But You Can Specify A Larger Number (Not Recommended)
      <br>![ThreadedMode](https://github.com/StellarSt0rm/CurseForgeDownloader2023/blob/b2ab628dab5f163cb7f609a015f3b2c408b4e312/README-RES/ThreadedM.png)
      <br>
      <br>
   3. No Color
      <br>Removes All Color, Except Bold
      <br>Usage: `python CSDownloader.py -n`
   
<br>

## TODO:
   1. Add `-u <url>` To Download Modpacks Directly (Without Needing The Zip Already Downloaded)
   2. Prepare Full "overrides" Folder With Everything To Make Final Installation Easier (HALF DONE)
      
   ‚ÄÉ?. Add GUI "Mode" (Will Be Separate Script)
