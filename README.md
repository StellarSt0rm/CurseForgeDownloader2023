Download Modpacks From CurseForge, BETA
<br>
$\color{red}\text{‚üÅ}$ Script Can Stop Working In The Future Due To Loaders/Hosts Changing Stuff
<br>
<br>
Tested With "Colony A New Odyssey - STABLE-1.0.7", Out Of 176 Mods, All Were Handled Correctly ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥
<br>
<br>
<br>
Code Is Fully $\color{blue}\text{COMMENTED}$ For Your Convenience üöÄ
<br>
<br>

## How To Install
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` To Make Sure You Have All The Needed Libraries
2. Put The Script In The Modpack Folder, And Run It From The Terminal:
   <br>`py ./CSDownloader.py` (MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE SCRIPT)
<br>

## Features
   1. Detailed Mode (SLOW - DEF)
      <br>Gives Detailed Output Of What The Script Is Doing
      <br>(IMAGE HERE)
      <br>
      <br>
   3. Threaded Mode (FAST - Bad For Slow Computers)
      <br>Goes BLAZINGLY FAST üöÄ ; Good For BIG Modpacks
      <br>$\color{red}\text{‚üÅ}$ Fast Is Relative To How Big The Modpack Is, But It's Faster Than Detailed Mode
      <br>Usage: `py ./CSDownloader.py -t <num / or "max">`
      <br>"max" Will Set The Max To '30', But You Can Specify A Larger Number (Not Recommended)

<br>

## TODO:
   1. Add Support To (Unzipped) Zip Files
   2. Add `-u <url>` To Download Modpacks Directly (Without Needing The Zip Already Downloaded)
   3. Prepare Full "overrides" Folder With Everything To Make Final Installation Easier
   4. Change The Way Arguments Are Handled
   5. Add `-n` Option To Disable Colors (Will Keep Bold)
      
   ‚ÄÉ?. Add GUI "Mode" (Will Be Separate Script)
